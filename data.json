Each section is printed on a mix of coated papers, silver, milk, and ivory. \nThe artworks are fragmented into sixteen zoomed-in pages, inviting nonlinear exploration—lingering on details, flipping between pages, and uncovering new compositions. By shifting focus from the whole artwork and for allowing the details and textures to shine, Textures challenges the viewer to engage with overlooked moments in the creative process. Namely zooming in.",

With limited time for deep reading, their focus shifted to the immediate qualities of each book—how it felt, opened, bent, or even smelled. \nInspired by this exploration, the selection was scanned in different ways to highlight the materiality and movement of the books. The layout mirrors the jury’s dynamic engagement, creating a visual narrative that celebrates the physicality of the publications.\n The catalogue was printed in offset by Drukkerij Tielen\nPhotos taken by Jón Helgi Pálmason.",

Through this exploration, Einar uncovers his father's extensive body of work from his time at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam and the works of his contemporaries. \nThe workshop emphasises the joy of creation and the possibilities in today's society. Participants visualise various aspects of stories, prompts, sketches, and more from the archives surrounding Einar’s father. \nThroughout the graduation show the table will be adorned with spreads which end up in different zines, that participants embellish using the provided tools. This work goes beyond just a creative process—seeking to create a welcoming atmosphere for discovery, connection, and playfulness. \n Photos taken by Roel Backaert.",

A sticker on a lamppost that has been partially scratched away, a torn poster, weathered advertisements, fog damage on a window, a scratch on a container or a scribble on a wall.\nThese so-called events leave a trail of beautiful, unexpected forms that tend to be forgotten in everyday life, something we see, but pay no attention to. Some years ago, I started collecting pictures of such forms/events wherever I went, and it turned into a picture book. The shapes and forms in the collection often end up in prints one way or another.\n\nNow they have become a series in the show “Another Þrykk Up My Sleeve” (þrykk being a word for printing in Icelandic). The shapes and forms are used and put together in a variety of ways – sometimes they dance together or entangle each other. \nPhotos taken by Haukur Sigurðsson",
